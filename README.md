## Project Proposals

### Project 1
#### Music Genre Identificaiton

1. Introduction to the problem statement

    Have you ever visited a coffee shop and actually liked their taste in music? Maybe you enjoyed the music tempo, the vocals, or the lyrics. Whatever it was, you wanted to know what kind of music is being played (the genre). With the modern advancement in machine learning (and technology in general) it is possible to make computers listen to and identify sounds. So, can we build and deploy and ML model that can classify music into different genres?

2. Abstract (rough draft)

    In this project, we want to build and deploy a machine learning model that can classify a 30-second song recording into multiple categories (genres)
    The user can open the app and press a button to record a playing song for a pre-determined time. The model would then classify the recorded sound and notify the user of the genre of the song playing.


3. Approach
      1. Build and train a Deep Learning model to classify sound clips (wav format) into different genres.
      2. Build the app (front-end) that can record sounds.
      3. Build the back-end that 
          1. supports recieving sound recordings from the front end for model analysis.
          2. supports sending results of model analysis to the front end.
    
4. Persona

    User with phone that wants to identify the genre of a currently-playing song.

### Project 2
#### Sentiment analysis of product reviews


 1. Introduction to the problem statement
 Product reviews on the internet have made the communication between the provider and customer a closed feedback loop. Sentiment analysis of the reviews can help product managers to track how the product is performing, feedback for future planning, shifts in public perception with changes in the newer releases, etc. Though if this process is manual, this would be a waste of time and resources. Moreover, with popular products, manually doing the sentiment analysis would also be extremely inefficient.
 
 2. Abstract
 In this project, we propose to build and deploy a machine learning sentiment analysis model that can classify the polarity of the reviews. The deployed application would allow users to submit a review for sentiment analysis. The polarity of the submitted review will be predicted by our model and displayed as a response.
 
 3. Approach
      1. Build and train a model using the amazon reviews dataset to predict the polarity of reviews.
      2. Build the app (front-end) that allows to submit a review.
      3. Build the back-end that:
          1. Supports submitting a review for analysis.
          2. Supports sending results of sentiment analysis back to the front end.
 
 4. Persona
 Product managers who get insights on how their product is performing based on the feedback from customers.

 Project 3
 
 Predicting heart disease 
 
 1. Introdcution to the problem statement:
   Science has been striving for years to make human life comfortable and to protect them from disease. This project is a step in that direction. By identifying
  heart issues earlier by a Machine learning predction model we can detect heart issue early and strat the required treatment
  
  2. Abstratct:
    In this project we propose to build and deploy a machine learning model that takes in various attributes from a user/patient and tries to predict the 
  occurence of a heart disease.
  
  3.Approach:
    3.1 Build a machine learning model (either SVM or Neural Networks) to predict the chances of heart attack.
    3.2 Build a front end for the app which would ask for user input 
    3.3 The back end would involve receiving the data from the front end and predicting the chances of heart attack and sending it to the front end.
  
4. Persona:
    Users who would like to know their chances of heart battack for an earlier treatment.
